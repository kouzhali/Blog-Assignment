### Phoolan Devi, the ‘bandit queen of India’.   

##
 A murderer, a goddess, and a liberator, Phoolan Devi was born in 1963 to a poor, low-caste family in Uttar Pradesh, India. Her village was dominated by powerful upper-caste individuals, perpetuating systemic oppression. Phoolan Devi rose to become India’s most notorious outlaw, fighting for the poor and vulnerable. After spending 11 years in jail, she transformed into a Member of Parliament and a prominent leader for India’s lower castes. Many saw Phoolan as an incarnation of Goddess Durga, the revered Hindu deity who symbolizes the triumph of good over evil.

This blog explores how Phoolan Devi radiates feminine power while pursuing justice, reflecting the resemblance to Goddess Durga. From an early age, she faced daily abuses. As the fourth daughter in a poor family, her mother harbored resentment because she had hoped for a son, believing that sons were easier to support than daughters. Phoolan grew up in a society where *“a rich man can give orders, he can beat you, punish you, because he is a landowner, he has the power of life and death over us”* (164). Her rage was slowly fueling; at only 11 years old, she was forced to marry Putti Lal, a 35-year-old widower infamous for his brutality and known for torturing his first wife to death. After her marriage, Devi suffered several instances of sexual and physical abuse from her husband. After multiple attempts to escape, she finally ended her marriage. As an unmarried woman, she faced family shame and harassment. Her rebelliousness intensified when she noticed that workers on a construction project were not being paid despite demanding their wages from the landlord. This led the 16-year-old Phoolan and her sister to demolish the house they had built to punish the landlord for not paying the workers. She reflected, *“I felt I had a physical power over something for the first time in my life, the power of destruction, the dark force of Durga, the goddess”* (167).

After her first rebellion, she was framed for theft and jailed. Despite multiple incarcerations, she continued to fight her oppressors, especially men who abused women. She hit rock bottom when she was captured by a gang of bandits sent by her own cousin. There, she endured multiple abuses, rapes, and beatings, intensifying her hatred towards men. Upon her escape, she swore by the goddess to avenge herself against those men because *“To be born a woman, I knew, was to be born powerless”* (169). Rejecting traditional roles, she decided not to take orders from anyone and vowed to become a leader herself. In pursuit of her revenge, she formed her own gang and avenged herself by killing all those involved in the gang that assaulted her, an event famously known as the Behmai Massacre. In the aftermath, a massive police manhunt was launched to capture Phoolan Devi and her gang. After years on the run, she surrendered to the police on February 12, 1983. Phoolan Devi laid down her arms and bowed before a picture of Goddess Durga before surrendering. She was jailed for 11 years upon her return and was highly respected not only by women but also by men in her society, who feared her.

After her release from jail, Phoolan became a Member of Parliament. She had a powerful voice, advocating for social justice and empowerment. Her story gained fame, and her persona as Durga was often portrayed. However, it was sometimes distorted by male journalists and politicians due to her illiteracy and her new role in Indian politics. Others viewed her story as one of resilience against oppression and saw the possibility of redemption through her actions. They regarded her as the incarnation of Goddess Durga, sent to restore righteousness and improve the lives of oppressed women. Regardless of others' perceptions, she continued to fight against marginalization and focused on women’s rights. Her status stirred resentment among her enemies, ultimately leading to her being brutally shot in 2001. She tragically died at the age of 37 before reaching the hospital.

Phoolan Devi’s transition from outlaw to lawmaker is remarkable. She marked India’s history as a woman who stood up and took matters into her own hands. *“Phoolan became at once both symbol and avenger of atrocities committed against the lower castes—a woman who had taken justice into her own hands and achieved a singular vindication, despite her own bloody, violent trail"* (175). She embodies feminine power, taking the law into her own hands and gaining respect not only for herself but also for other women. She brought societal issues to public attention, prompting changes and empowering women to speak up. She was committed to helping the vulnerable, especially poor women who suffered under abusive husbands. She advocated for financial support for poor women, stating, *“Without money, women were forced to suffer hunger and humiliation, and even sell their bodies like sacks of flour”* (169). No one could have achieved what she did—a warrior like Goddess Durga, sent to earth to punish evils and restore good. Just as Phoolan Devi challenged the patriarchal society, she paved the way for women to gain respect and a voice in a society where they previously had none.
