---

## **Phoolan Devi, the ‘ bandit queen of India’.**                            

A murderer, goddess and liberator; she was born in 1963 in a poor low-caste family in Uttar Pradesh India where her village was dominated by upper caste powerful people. Phoolan Devi became India’s most notorious outlaw by having her own gang after she fled from her abusive marriage. She fought oppression against the poor especially the vulnerable, was jailed for 11 years, and later on became a Member of the Parliament and a prominent leader of India’s lower caste. Phoolan Devi is seen as an incarnation of the goddess Durga, a major hindu goddess who is known to fight for good over evil. The goddess is known for killing a demon named Mahishasura, who was unattainable to any man, thus showing that Devi fought against powerful people whom no one could lay their hands on. Goddess Durga is also known for riding a tiger, which emphasizes her fierce nature, authority and power.
