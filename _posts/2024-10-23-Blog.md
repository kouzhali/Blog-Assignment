**_The sword and it's tale_**

Her sword, revered as a symbol of protection, skill, and victory 
in both the physical and spiritual realms, is one of the material objects of Goddess Durga
which was created to defeat a demon called Mahishasura.He went into a deep meditative state to get as boon eternal life from Lord Bramha and that
no man or Gods should be able to kill him which was granted under the condition that only a woman can kill him. Years went by and
Mahishasura began destroying the world around him. Hence many people began praying to the Gods that they should stop him and that is how
Goddess Durga was created with the combined energies of Lord Shiva, Lord Vishnu and Lord Bramha; the three main Gods in hinduism. Each god contributed weapons and 
armor to make her invincible in war; the sword was given to her by Lord Ganesha which represents wisdom, the sharpness of intellect,
and the destruction of ignorance. It was a tough battle that went on for days as Mahishasura had the ability to switch forms and finally
Goddess Durga was able to behead him when he turned into a buffalo as quoted in the sacred book Devi Mahatmya (Chapter 10, Verse 16): 
*"The goddess Durga, fierce and radiant, fought valiantly with the demon Mahishasura. With her sword, she finally cut off his head,
thus restoring order and righteousness."*

**_Festivals and rituals_**

This victory symbolises the win of good over evil and hence the devotees celebrate the Navaratri(Durga Puja) festival where her worship
is associated with themes of victory, protection, and the celebration of feminine power.
In the worship of Durga, the sword is often ritually placed near her idol or image, symbolizing her strength and readiness to destroy 
negativity and darkness; during Navaratri for ten days the devotees fast which is seen as a form of purification and offer their prayers 
to the Goddess to receive her seeking her blessings for health, prosperity, and protection. During Navaratri, Kanya Puja is observed, where young girls who are a 
representation of the Goddess are worshipped and offered food and gifts. On the last day of the fast, priests may invoke 
Durgaâ€™s power in the sword during rituals, treating it as an embodiment of the goddess herself. I personally assisted a prayer during that 
ritual and the priest uses the sword during prayer after worshipping the Goddess, he slays off a banana tree which represents the demon 
The sword is used as a form of spiritual liberation to cut the bonds of attachment, ego, and ignorance, guiding the disciple toward spiritual 
enlightenment and wisdom.

world to not let fear determine their actions. Further, she displays that with the positive motivation and surrounding , then there is virtually no limits to
