## Phoolan Devi, the ‘bandit queen of India’.                            

A murderer, goddess and liberator; she was born in 1963 in a poor low-caste family in Uttar Pradesh India where her village was dominated by upper caste powerful people. Phoolan Devi became India’s most notorious outlaw by having her own gang after she fled from her abusive marriage. She fought oppression against the poor especially the vulnerable women, was jailed for 11 years, and later on became a Member of the Parliament and a prominent leader of India’s lower caste. Phoolan Devi is seen as an incarnation of the goddess Durga, a major goddess in the religion of hinduism who is known to fight for good over evil. The goddess is known for killing a demon named Mahishasura, who was unattainable to any man, thus showing that Devi fought against powerful people whom no one could lay their hands on. Goddess Durga is also known for riding a tiger, which emphasizes her fierce nature, authority and power.

This blog is to show how Phoolan Devi radiates feminine power whilst pursuing justice on her own which reflects on the resemblance of the Goddess Durga. Since an early age she was faced to daily abuses, being the fourth daughter born in the family especially in poor condition, her mother had a lot of hatred towards her as she had expected to bear a son because during that time having a son was deemed to be easier to look after than having a daughter. She grew up in a society where ‘a rich man can give orders, he can beat you, punish you, because he is a landowner, he has the power of life and death over us’ (164). Phoolan’s rage was slowly fueling; at only 11 years old she was forced to marry Putti Lal, a 35-year old widower, a man renowned for his brutality and known for torturing his first wife to death. After her marriage, Devi suffered several sexual and physical abuses from his husband. After several attempts to escape, she was finally able to end her marriage. Now, as an unmarried girl family shame and harassment plagued her life (166-167). Her rebelliousness increased when she noticed that while working on a construction project, workers were not getting paid despite them demanding their wages from the landlord. There comes the 16 year-old and her sister demolishing the house they just built to punish the landlord for not paying the workers, ‘I felt I had a physical power over something for the first time in my life, the power of destruction, the dark force of Durga, the goddess’ (167).
