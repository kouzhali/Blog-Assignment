### Phoolan Devi, the ‘bandit queen of India’.   

##
A murderer, goddess and liberator; she was born in 1963 in a poor low-caste family in Uttar Pradesh India where her village was dominated by upper caste powerful people. Phoolan Devi became India’s most notorious outlaw where she fought oppression against the poor especially the vulnerable, was jailed for 11 years, and later on became a Member of the Parliament and a prominent leader of India’s lower caste. Phoolan Devi is seen as an incarnation of the goddess Durga, a major hindu goddess who is known to fight for good over evil. Durga is a principal form of supreme goddess known as the divine feminine energy in Hinduism. The goddess is known for killing a demon named Mahishasura, who was unattainable to any man, thus showing that Devi fought against powerful people whom no one could lay their hands on. Goddess Durga is also known for riding a tiger, which emphasizes her fierce nature, authority and power.

This blog is to show how Phoolan Devi radiates feminine power whilst pursuing justice on her own which reflects on the resemblance of the Goddess Durga. Since an early age she was faced to daily abuses, being the fourth daughter born in the family especially in poor condition, her mother had a lot of hatred towards her as she had expected to bear a son because during that time having a son was deemed to be easier to look after than having a daughter. She grew up in a society where *‘a rich man can give orders, he can beat you, punish you, because he is a landowner, he has the power of life and death over us’* (164). Phoolan’s rage was slowly fueling; at only 11 years old she was forced to marry Putti Lal, a 35-year old widower, a man renowned for his brutality and known for torturing his first wife to death. After her marriage, Devi suffered several sexual and physical abuses from his husband. After several attempts to escape, she was finally able to end her marriage. Now, as an unmarried girl family shame and harassment plagued her life (166-167). Her rebelliousness increased when she noticed that while working on a construction project, workers were not getting paid despite them demanding their wages from the landlord. There comes the 16 year-old and her sister demolishing the house they just built to punish the landlord for not paying the workers, *‘I felt I had a physical power over something for the first time in my life, the power of destruction, the dark force of Durga, the goddess’* (167).

After her first rebellion, she was then framed for theft and was jailed. Despite multiple repetition of those events, she kept fighting those oppressors especially females who would face abuses from their husbands or any other male. She then hit rock bottom when she was captured by a gang of bandits who was sent from her own cousin. There, she suffered multiples abuses, rapes and beatings, her hatred towards men grew more and more.Upon her escape, she swore by the goddess that she would avenge herself from those men because *‘To be born a woman, I knew, was to be born powerless’* (169). She no longer wanted to be a woman, she didn’t want to take orders from anybody, she was going to be the leader herself. In pursuit of her own revenge she made her own gang and avenged herself, with her lust for vengeance she killed all the people that were involved in the gang that assaulted her which is famously known as the ‘Behmai Massacre’. In the aftermath of the massacre, a massive police manhunt was launched to capture Phoolan Devi and her gang. After years on the run, she surrendered to the police on 12th February 1983. Phoolan Devi layed down her arms and bowed before a picture of the Goddess Durga and surrendered.She was then jailed for 11 years upon her return she was highly respected by not only the women but also the man in her society, they feared her.

After her release from jail, Phoolan became a Member of the Parliament. She had a powerful voice serving as an MP for social justice and empowerment. Her story became famous, her Durga created persona was however distorted by many male journalists and politicians since she was illiterate and was now in the Indian Politics. Others saw her story as resilience against oppression and saw the possibility of redemption through her. They saw her as the incarnation of goddess Durga, she came to restore this place, to make it a better place for us, women, us who are being oppressed. Regardless of what others thought of her she continued serving against marginalization and focused on women’s rights. However, her status stirred resentment among her enemies which led to her being brutally shot in 2001. She unfortunately died at the age of 37 before she could reach the hospital.

Phoolan Devi’s transition from outlaw to lawmaker is remarkable. She marked India’s story as being a woman to stand up and to go to such an extent to take matter into her own hands. *‘Phoolan became at once both symbol and avenger of atrocities committed against the lower castes- a women who had taken justice into her own hands and achieved a singular vindication, despite her own bloody, violent trail.’* (175) She is the definition of feminine power taking the law into her hands gain respect for not only herself but also for other women. She brought up matters that were concerning from their society to the public eye which brought changes, women were not afraid to speak up. She liked helping the vulnerable especially poor women, those who would suffer under their husbands. She liked to have the power of giving money to the poor especially poor women because, *‘Without money, women were forced to suffer hunger and humiliation, and even sell their bodies like sacks of flour.’* (169) No one could have done it like she did, a warrior she is, just like the goddess Durga who was sent to earth to punish all the evils and restore good things. The same way that Phoolan Devi took this patriarchal society by storm, who would have thought that women would have been respected in a place where they didn’t even have a say for anything.
